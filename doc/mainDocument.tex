\section{Signal processing and Recurrence plot}
\label{sec:motivation}
\subsection{Signal processing}

A signal is a function that conveys information about the behaviour of a system
or attributes of some phenomenon \cite{priemer1990introductory}.
For example, measuring the time taken between a weight-driven
pendulum clock's ticks produces signal.
In turn, for the scope of this paper, we defined the term signal processing as
\textit{the science of analyzing time-varying processes} 
\cite{lyons2004understanding}.
By processing a signal we analyzed the non-triviality of a given signal.
Analyzing a signal reveals that some signals 
have properties that can be categorized.

\subsection{Signal property categories}


We have considered the following categories:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Stationary and non stationary signals
  \item 
\end{enumerate}


Signals have varying properties. Some consist of simple repetitions while others
have no apparent patterns.
For example, measuring the time taken between a weight-driven
pendulum clock's ticks produces a relatively simple (trivial) signal.

\section{Web application development}
This project is aimed at creating a web application allowing one to interact with the recurrence plot algorithm in a user friendly manner.
The project offers a feature of classifying data based on the generated plot using convolutional neural networks.
This is an effort to further spread the popularity of this algorithm and help users intuitively grasp how it behaves.


\subsection{Analysis of analogous tools}
As of the date of publishing, only one tool was located capable 
of generating a recurrence plot online \cite{recurrence_plot_tk}. 
There are multiple implementations of the recurrence plot in Python as well as other
languages, but none offer the ability to classify data based on the generated image.

It is noteworthy, that the aforementioned implementations require at least a minimal undertanding of software programming, a computing machine and specific software to compile and run the code. 
This is laborious and is not likely to attract new users to experiment with algorithm.
Based on these factors, a decision was made to create a web based application that requires
as little user knowledge to get started with the algorithm as possible.


\subsection{Architecture}
This project uses the microservices. 
Microservices are small autonomous services deployed independently, with a single and clearly defined purpose \cite{krause2015microservices}. This design approach was chosen due to the flexibility and scalability associated with the architecture. %%%% %%Probably useless sentence
The nature of microservices allows one to easily test, modify or out right replace each one of the components giving more freedom to the developer.
The project ecosystem consists of the following microservices:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Front end web application
	\item Back end for the web application
	\item Python web server for plotting operations
\end{enumerate}

Communication between microservices is performed via HTTP requests. In general, a query with JSON body is sent to a service and a JSON response along side an image attachment is returned.
Figure~\ref{fig:architecture_diagram} illustrates the microservice architecture of the project and data flow within each service.

\subsection{Project structure}
The project is structured so that each microservice resides in an independent directory:
\begin{itemize}
  \item app/
  \begin{itemize}
    \item src/
    \begin{itemize}
      \item components/
    \end{itemize}
    \item public/
  \end{itemize}
  \item server/
  \begin{itemize}
    \item db/
    \item public/
    \item utils/
  \end{itemize}
  \item plotter/
  \begin{itemize}
    \item jupyter/
  \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
As listed above the structure may be confusing, therefore we will now go more in depth into each one of the services.

  \label{fig:architecture_diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Microservices}
The tools used for microservice development were largely open-sourced and relatively modern. 
Front end and Back end services were written in javascript  
based environments - React JS and Node JS respectively.
These choises were made due to the widespread use of javascript in modern web application development providing a large pool of open-sourced libraries and tools.

On the other hand python was the tool used to develop the plotting service. It is known to perform better on data handling and machine learning than javascript alternatives. \cite{javascript_vs_python_ml}
Both Python and Node JS have certain strengths and thus have appropriate community driven libraries and modules to reinforce their leverages in appropriate operations.

\subsubsection{Front end service}
The front end service is developed using React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. \cite{react_home}
Following the best practices of React development, the app is into reuseable components. Each component returns a JSX object



\subsubsection{Back end service}
\subsubsection{Plotter service}


%We will go more in depth about each microservice in later sections.


% For the scope of this paper, we defined the term signal 
% processing as \textit{the science of analyzing time-varying 
% processes} \cite{lyons2004understanding}.




% \subsection{Signal classification}
% Signals have several classes. For the scope of this paper we considered
% the classes \cite{lathi1998signal}:
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Stationary and non-stationary signals
%   \item 
%   \item Periodic, quasi periodic and aperiodic signals 


% \end{enumerate}






% Some signals are inherently simple such as the time taken
% a falling object or

% \begin{lstlisting}
%   sygnalStates = []

%   # Generate data pairs, tripplets, quadruplets... D - plets
%   for i in range(0, self.M):
%       state = []

%       for j in range(0, self.D):
%           state.append(self.data[i+(j*self.d)])

%       sygnalStates.append(state)
% \end{lstlisting}

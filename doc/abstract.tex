The goal of this project was to create a web application for generating and classifying recurrence plots that are used to visualize data regularities and randomness.
The application was successfully developed and features a responsive design allowing access from desktop and mobile users.
Classification feature is implemented by training a convolutional neural network.
It can effectively distinguish chaotic, period and trending data types.
The paper dives into the application development process.
It also details the convolutional neural network data generation, training and testing procedures.
A conclusion was reached that a convolutional neural network can identify data characteristic by analyzing a recurrence plot image.

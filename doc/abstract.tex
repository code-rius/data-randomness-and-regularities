The goal of this project was to create a web application for generating and classifying recurrence plots that are used to visualize data regularities and randomness.
The application features a responsive design allowing access from desktop and mobile users.
Classification feature is implemented by training a convolutional neural network.
It effective distinguishes chaotic, period and trending data types.
The paper dives into the application development process.
It also details the convolutional nerual network data generation, training and testing procdures.
A concolusion was reached that a convolutional neural network can identify data characteristic by analyzing a recurrence plot image.

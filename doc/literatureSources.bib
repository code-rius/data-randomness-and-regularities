  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) generate much richer function spaces than shallow networks. Since the function spaces induced by shallow networks have several approximation theoretic drawbacks, this explains, however, not necessarily the success of deep networks. In this article we take another route by comparing the expressive power of DNNs with ReLU activation function to linear spline methods. We show that MARS (multivariate adaptive regression splines) is improper learnable by DNNs in the sense that for any given function that can be expressed as a function in MARS with M parameters there exists a multilayer neural network with O(Mlog(M∕ε)) parameters that approximates this function up to sup-norm error ε. We show a similar result for expansions with respect to the Faber–Schauder system. Based on this, we derive risk comparison inequalities that bound the statistical risk of fitting a neural network by the statistical risk of spline-based methods. This shows that deep networks perform better or only slightly worse than the considered spline methods. We provide a constructive proof for the function approximations.}

  title     = "Recurrence Plots for the Analysis of Complex Systems",
  abstract  = "Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e.g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls.",

Among different types of deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks have been most extensively studied. Leveraging on the rapid growth in the amount of the annotated data and the great improvements in the strengths of graphics processor units, the research on convolutional neural networks has been emerged swiftly and achieved state-of-the-art results on various tasks. In this paper, we provide a broad survey of the recent advances in convolutional neural networks. We detailize the improvements of CNN on different aspects, including layer design, activation function, loss function, regularization, optimization and fast computation. Besides, we also introduce various applications of convolutional neural networks in computer vision, speech and natural language processing.}

  abstract  = {Overfitting is a fundamental issue in supervised machine learning which prevents us from perfectly generalizing the models to well fit observed data on training data, as well as unseen data on testing set. Because of the presence of noise, the limited size of training set, and the complexity of classifiers, overfitting happens. This paper is going to talk about overfitting from the perspectives of causes and solutions. To reduce the effects of overfitting, various strategies are proposed to address to these causes: 1) “early-stopping” strategy is introduced to prevent overfitting by stopping training before the performance stops optimize; 2) “network-reduction” strategy is used to exclude the noises in training set; 3) “data-expansion” strategy is proposed for complicated models to fine-tune the hyper-parameters sets with a great amount of data; and 4) “regularization” strategy is proposed to guarantee models performance to a great extent while dealing with real world issues by feature-selection, and by distinguishing more useful and less useful features.}

The unknown or only partially known functional context of differentially expressed genes may be assessed by querying the Gene Ontology database via GOMiner. Resulting tree representations are difficult to interpret and are not suited for visualization of this type of data. Methods are needed to effectively visualize these complex set relationships.Results: We present a visualization approach for set relationships based on Venn diagrams. The proposed extension enhances the usual notion of Venn diagrams by incorporating set size information. The cardinality of the sets and intersection sets is represented by their corresponding circle (polygon) sizes. To avoid local minima, solutions to this problem are sought by evolutionary optimization. This generalized Venn diagram approach has been implemented as an interactive Java application (VennMaster) specifically designed for use with GOMiner in the context of the Gene Ontology database.Availability: VennMaster is platform-independent (Java 1.4.2) and has been tested on Windows (XP, 2000), Mac OS X, and Linux.
